This is master vault and one-window reference to analyse, build , implement and research all Unsupervised machine learning projects. The idea is to help ML community in their quest to make a better world by actively contributing and collaborating through real-world projects that are data driven, decentralized and involves computation.

I strongly believe that through strong communication of like minded people (ML Enthisiasts) we can change our society with the emerging technologies of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I would hereby callout to other people who share the same or similar goal to join me in the mission by making valuable contribution to my project repositories.
